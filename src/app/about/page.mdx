# Deep Domain Problems: Beyond Surface-Level Solutions

I'm Rajiv, co-founder of Betalectic. Ten years ago, I started with a simple thought: "If I don't have any ideas, let's make others' ideas happen."

As my team tackled challenges across diverse domains, we needed to categorize the problems. Inspired by domain-driven design (DDD), I coined the term "Deep Domain Problems" (DDP).

While I'm still refining the definition, I can share its characteristics.

The question that sparked this concept was: "What problems would we solve next?" 

I wasn't thinking about Betalectic specifically but our collective efforts as problem-solvers. Over the past 15 years, I've witnessed dramatic changes in our interactions with businesses and the world. There's an app for everything now, which makes me proud as an Indian to be among such innovative problem solvers. India's scale and population have positioned it uniquely during this transformation. I call these consumer experience problems (B2C), and we've solved countless of them. For business owners, we've seen tremendous improvements in business software, with new solutions launching daily.

Having contributed to creating even a tiny portion of this software ecosystem, I'm naturally drawn to solving consumer problems first and then addressing business needs when they can be generalized. Looking closely at these solutions, we often see wrappers built over legacy systems—which isn't inherently negative. This approach exists because it's relatively straightforward to bypass understanding a domain's complexities by simply creating a layer over it.

There are multiple approaches to solving the underlying challenges:

1. Discard existing processes and start fresh—typically impractical
2. Invest time in understanding how systems work and their interdependencies—these complex systems power our financial infrastructure, supply chains, and industries, requiring decades to comprehend fully
3. Collaborate extensively with domain experts—the approach I advocate

Solving Deep Domain Problems isn't about disruption but thoughtful transformation. Success requires a genuine partnership between industry veterans who understand these challenges and technologists committed to building lasting solutions without compromising what already works—bridging decades of expertise with modern technology.

I've been fortunate to work with passionate, persistent entrepreneurs who bring deep expertise. They provide the domain knowledge; we provide the technological capabilities.

My vision for deepdomainproblems.com serves several purposes. Though I may not be able to move mountains, I believe that with a bit of persistence, I can make a positive impact:

1. **Support for Deep Domain Problem Solvers**: These experts have invested decades in  understanding industry intricacies, regulations, and practical operations. They need architects and domain modelers beyond typical app developers. Just as domain expertise develops over time, so does programming wisdom.

2. **Connection to Deep-Problem Programmers**: First-world countries have staff engineers who continue coding after 25+ years rather than moving into management because they love solving complex problems. Connecting them with DDPs could significantly improve solutions at India's scale. This requires a commitment to domains rather than changing fields frequently for salary increases.

3. **Funding for Deep Work**: Daily demands may limit flexibility to commit to a single domain. Solving DDPs resembles R&D—it needs funding for experimentation, scaling, and influence, plus sufficient incentives to encourage participation.

4. **Documentation of Methodologies**: We must interview successful problem-solvers and document approaches for tackling DDPs, recognizing that solutions aren't one-size-fits-all.

Ultimately, our most outstanding achievement would be establishing "DDP" as a widely recognized concept, similar to how everyone understands "SaaS." Once identified as a Deep Domain Problem, challenges can be addressed with appropriate tools and methodologies.
