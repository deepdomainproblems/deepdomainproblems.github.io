After a decade of digital transformation projects, I’ve learned a key lesson: the most valuable opportunities don’t come from building more apps or dashboards. They lie in solving what I call *Deep Domain Problems* (DDPs)—complex, high-impact challenges that demand domain expertise and technical innovation. Here’s how to spot them and decide which ones are worth your effort.

## What Makes a Problem "Deep"?  
DDPs aren’t just complicated—they’re significant, systemic, and stubbornly resistant to quick fixes. They share these traits:  

### 1. They Demand Specialized Domain Knowledge  
You can’t solve a DDP with tech alone. You need to grasp:  
- Industry-specific processes honed over decades  
- Regulatory frameworks shaping the field  
- Undocumented "tribal knowledge"  
- Nuanced stakeholder dynamics  

*Example*: In aerospace manufacturing, quality control experts juggle thousands of parameters—material properties, production methods, safety rules—tailored to aircraft type and destination country.  

### 2. They Rely on Tacit Expertise  
When experts say, "It depends" or "You learn it with time," they signal tacit knowledge—skills not found in manuals. Look for:  
- Decisions hard to explain step-by-step  
- Roles taking years to master  
- Gaps between documentation and practice  
- Context driving different outcomes  

### 3. They Span Systems and Stakeholders  
DDPs cross boundaries:  
- Legacy systems that don’t play nice  
- Stakeholders with clashing priorities  
- Organizational silos  
- Trade-offs like efficiency vs. compliance  

*Case in Point*: The 2020-2023 supply chain crisis exposed DDPs in resilience—companies couldn’t track inventory across tiers or predict bottlenecks without deep domain insight.  

### 4. They Defy Simple Automation  
Past attempts at solving DDPs often yield:  
- Partial fixes for routine cases  
- Workarounds that spawn new issues  
- High exception rates needing human intervention  
- Tools users ignore despite the functionality  

## How to Spot High-Value DDPs  
Here’s a practical playbook to uncover DDPs worth tackling:  

### 1. Hunt for Persistent *and Emerging* Manual Processes  
Look where skilled pros still work by hand—or where new tech creates friction.  
- *Examples*: Underwriters reviewing edge-case applications; moderators overwhelmed by AI-generated content.  

### 2. Listen for Telltale Language  
Ear on for phrases like:  
- "The system doesn’t get that we need to..."  
- "There’s an art to knowing when..."  
- "You develop a knack for spotting..."  
These reveal gaps between tools and reality.  

### 3. Pinpoint "Translation" Roles  
Find people bridging systems or teams:  
- *Examples*: Finance reconciling ERP and billing; admins mastering procedural exceptions.  
These roles often orbit DDPs.  

### 4. Trace Exceptions and Validate  
Follow breakdowns in standard workflows:  
1. Map a process.  
2. Spot where exceptions arise.  
3. Track who fixes them and how.  
4. Quantify impact—e.g., "20% of cases need rework, costing $100K yearly."  

### 5. Target High-Value Decisions, Then Refine  
Zero in on expert judgments driving significant outcomes—then sharpen the focus:  
- *Example*: From "risky loans" to "loans with patchy credit signals" after expert input.  
- *Fields*: Healthcare diagnostics, financial risk, crisis resource allocation.

  **Quick-Start Checklist**:  
  - ☑ Manual tasks resisting automation?  
  - ☑ Experts saying "it depends"?  
  - ☑ Boundary-spanning roles?  
  - ☑ Frequent exceptions with high costs?  
  - ☑ Decisions swaying major results?

## Evaluating DDP Opportunities  
Not every DDP is worth solving. Weigh them against:  

### 1. Impact Potential  
- Who’s affected, and how many?  
- What’s the cost of the status quo?  
- Incremental fix or game-changer?  

### 2. Readiness to Solve  
- Can you access domain know-how? (If not, try reports or proxies like retirees.)  
- Are experts open to collaborating?  
- Is tech up to the task?  

### 3. Market Forces  
- Persistent problem or new pain point?  
- Are organizations hunting for answers?  
- Is pressure (regulation, competition) mounting?  

### 4. Complexity Balance  
- Is the hurdle more domain or tech?  
- Can current tools model the knowledge? (e.g., NLP for regs, but not "gut feel")  
- Does partial progress add value?  

## Real-World Example: Patient Triage in Emergency Departments  
Consider triaging patients in a bustling ER:  
- *Domain Needs*: Clinical symptoms, patient history, resource availability.  
- *Tacit Smarts*: Nurses gauging severity from subtle cues—like a patient’s pallor or breathing rhythm.  
- *System Mess*: EHRs, bed tracking, and disjointed staff communication tools.  
- *Automation Resistance*: Algorithms flag vitals but miss context; veteran staff still override often.  
*Why It’s Worth It*: Better triage cuts wait times, saves lives, and eases staff burnout—partial wins still transform throughput.  

## Beyond Healthcare: Broader Cases  
- *Education*: Scheduling across districts—teacher preferences, union rules, student needs—defies generic software.  
- *Content Moderation*: AI flags posts, but human nuance catches escalating edge cases.  

## Tools to Get Started  
- *Process Mapping*: Diagram exceptions (try [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com)).  
- *Interviews*: Record experts to capture tacit gems.  
- *Data*: Measure exception rates or downtime costs.  

## Watch the Risks  
Don’t chase a loud stakeholder’s pet peeve—cross-check with data and diverse voices to confirm it’s a true DDP.  

## Conclusion  
Deep Domain Problems hide in plain sight, masquerading as "just how it works" in an industry. They’re where complex knowledge meets technical limits—and where solving them sparks transformative value. As AI races ahead, spotting DDPs separates shallow wins (digitizing the obvious) from deep innovation. Pair AI’s power—say, pre-flagging risks—with human insight to define *what matters*, and you’ll unlock breakthroughs that reshape industries.
