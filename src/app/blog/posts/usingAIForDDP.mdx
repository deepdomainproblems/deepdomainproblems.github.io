Let me first define the kinds of problems Betalectic solves.

On the surface, we're a typical dev shop. Clients ask us to build web and mobile apps. They describe the interfaces their customers will use, and we build them. We code the backend and front end and deploy solutions. That's our simplified process.

But looking deeper, the problems we tackle address "deep domain problems." We've never built an e-commerce app in our lifetime, which surprises even us. We haven't created apps for marketing or branding.

Examining this pattern, we realized our clients are domain experts trying to digitize — sometimes revolutionize — entire industries. It's genuinely herculean work. Their customers are B2B entities used to "incumbent" standards, yet our clients aim to transform those standards. We're privileged to work on these domain challenges. These startups might fail or completely disrupt established processes.

Saying one of our clients solves problems in Banking, Procurement, or Finance understates the complexity. The gap between these domains and tech people (coders, architects) is that technologists don't grasp how vast these fields are — the regulations, compliance requirements, and variables. Learning one aspect isn't just reading ten textbooks; it requires twenty years of experience. Imagine spending two decades in a domain that isn't coding — like verifying suppliers for vendor selection, just one small part of Procurement.

The solution to these complex problems won't be AI alone; domain experts design solutions and apply AI strategically.

In development, I tell my team to solve problems twice: first, to make it work, and then to make it work well. When you're still figuring out the approach, creating an elegant solution immediately can be challenging. The prototype is that "eureka" moment when you prove something is possible.

Amazon Echo (featuring Alexa) took years of development before its 2014 release, not months. Voice assistants require extensive development across multiple technologies.

## How will AI change this?

Programmers typically:
- Solve the problem
- Solve the problem well
- Cycle through coding and testing until exhaustion

AI will help with all these, though differently. During problem-solving, it offers multiple solutions like a second-opinion doctor. But you must still choose the best approach — incomplete information will make AI exaggerate the problem.

AI will save engineers time in coding and testing. Is this happening already? Yes, though not yet efficiently. When AI creates bugs, finding them takes ten times longer. But this will change.

The benefit is that programmers will spend more time on solution design and collaboration with domain experts instead of mechanical coding.

We've barely scratched the surface of solving deep domain problems with computers and transferring expert knowledge into development models. Tech people also learn and transform specific domains (as at Cybrilla).

Before a conflict arises—with non-programmers thinking AI can handle all coding and programmers fearing obsolescence—let's agree that the real work is just beginning. Programmers will become domain experts' right hand, while AI will be programmers' right hand.

This setup will help programmers show SMEs where AI fits. If we rush to conclude AI has solved everything, creating tension between these groups, we'll face more significant problems while dealing with increasingly complex domains that support our economy. Simply put, the economy doesn't run on meditation apps — it's much bigger, messier, and deeper.
