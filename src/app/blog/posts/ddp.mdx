Over the last 15 years, I have witnessed significant changes in interacting with the world and businesses. There's an app for everything, which makes me, as a proud Indian, feel privileged to be among such great problem solvers. India holds a unique position in having gone through this shift because of its scale and population. I call these problems consumer experience problems or B2C, and we have solved countless of them. The next segment is business owners - there has been substantial improvement in general business software, and new apps are launched daily.

As someone involved in creating even a tiny fraction of this software, the inclination to solve any kind of consumer problem is high, followed by addressing business needs as long as they're generalized. When we look at the solutions closely, we see that wrappers are written over legacy systems (which isn't necessarily bad). There's a reason for this approach - it's relatively easy to bypass understanding a domain (its shape, its history) by simply wrapping it up.

There are multiple ways to solve the underlying problem:

You could discard the existing process and start from scratch - the most impractical approach.

Alternatively, you could understand how a particular system works and its interdependencies. These complex challenges power our financial systems, supply chains, and industries, but understanding them would take decades. A programmer can spend a decade learning and changing it or collaborate with domain experts for an extended period (this is the approach I advocate).

Solving these problems isn't about disruptionâ€”it's about thoughtful transformation. It demands deep collaboration between those who have lived the problems and those who can build the future without breaking what works, bridging decades of expertise with modern technology to solve fundamental industry challenges. Success requires a true partnership between industry veterans who've experienced these challenges and technologists committed to building thoughtful, lasting solutions.

I am fortunate to have worked with multiple such entrepreneurs whose passion and persistence are unquestionable. They are the experts, and we needed to be the technologists.

My vision for deepdomainproblems.com serves multiple purposes. Though I can't move mountains, hopefully, through sheer persistence, I can stir some clouds:

1. Deep Domain Problem Solvers need significantly more support from the tech industry. They have invested decades, not just years; they understand numerous intricacies and regulations and have practical experience. These problems require architects and domain modelers beyond app developers. Just as expertise and wisdom are gained with time in any domain, this also holds true for programmers.

2. Some programmers thrive on deep problems. First-world countries have seen their share of staff engineers who continue coding even after 25+ years rather than transitioning to leadership roles. They love programming. By connecting them to such problems, we might significantly improve things at India's scale. This can't be achieved by changing domains every other year for higher salaries but by creating an ecosystem where compensation is competitive, perhaps even superior.

3. Daily life's demands might not give everyone the flexibility to commit to one domain. However, solving DDP is like R&D; funding is needed to experiment, scale, and influence. It also requires sufficient incentives to encourage others to attempt it.

4. We must interview problem solvers and document what we learn about solving DDPs. We can't apply the same solution to every problem.

Ultimately, the most significant achievement is recognizing something as a DDP, just as we all understand what "SaaS" means. Once you identify a DDP, you can solve it using the right tools and the right approach.
