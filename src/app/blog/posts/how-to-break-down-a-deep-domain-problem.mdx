Identifying a Deep Domain Problem (DDP) worth solving is just the start. The real challenge is breaking it into pieces you can tackle. Here’s a systematic approach to decomposing DDPs into manageable, solvable components.

## Knowledge Extraction and Mapping

### 1. Build a Domain Glossary

Anchor your work with a shared vocabulary:

- Capture how experts define key terms (e.g., "risk" in finance vs. manufacturing).
- Note stakeholder-specific variations—same word, different meanings.
- Flag subtle distinctions (e.g., "policy" vs. "guideline").
- Track context-shifting definitions.

This glossary aligns your team and grounds all analysis. Here is an example showcasing that words in bold are glossary words.

Example: Jane, an **Influencer**, posted a viral **Tweet** about a new **Hashtag** trending on X. Her **Followers** quickly engaged, boosting the **Post Engagement** with likes and retweets. The **X Algorithm** pushed the content to more users, increasing Jane’s **Follower Count**. She celebrated by sharing a **Pinned Post** to thank her community.

### 2. Chart Expert Decision-Making

Unpack how pros navigate the domain:

- Interview varied experts on key workflows and record steps and gut calls.
- Pinpoint inputs they weigh (e.g., data, past cases).
- Highlight forks like "it depends"—these signal critical logic splits.
- Compare approaches across experts to spot patterns or gaps.

These maps expose the tacit smarts driving the domain. Below is an example.

```
START: Loan Application
├── Credit Score ≥ 600?
│   ├── Yes
│   │   ├── DTI ≤ 40%?
│   │   │   ├── Yes
│   │   │   │   ├── Cash Flow Positive?
│   │   │   │   │   ├── Yes → APPROVE
│   │   │   │   │   └── No → REJECT
│   │   │   └── No
│   │   │       ├── Cash Flow Improving?
│   │   │       │   ├── Yes → APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS
│   │   │       │   └── No → REJECT
│   │   └── No → REJECT
│   └── No
│       ├── Strong Business Plan?
│       │   ├── Yes → APPROVE WITH STRICT TERMS
│       │   └── No → REJECT
└── END
```

### 3. Pinpoint Knowledge Sources

Locate where truth lives:

- Formal: Regs, manuals, SOPs.
- Informal: Expert know-how, unwritten rules.
- Systems: Databases, legacy tools, external APIs.
- Tribal: Shop-floor wisdom or team lore.

Prioritize what to formalize first—start with what’s reliable and accessible.

## Structural Decomposition

### 1. Split Core from Support

Layer the problem by value:

- Core Domain: What’s unique and high-stakes (e.g., risk scoring in compliance).
- Supporting Domains: Essential but commodity (e.g., data entry).
- Generic Elements: Off-the-shelf stuff (e.g., login systems).

Focus innovation on the core; leverage existing tools elsewhere.

### 2. Define Bounded Contexts

Big domains fragment into sub-worlds:

- Map where concepts shift (e.g., "order" in sales vs. shipping).
- Trace data handoffs between contexts.
- Specify translation rules at boundaries.
- Flag which contexts sync vs. run solo.

This keeps your solution modular, not a bloated monolith.

### 3. Sketch Process Trees

For key workflows:

- Outline the "happy path" from start to finish.
- Mark decision nodes and their triggers.
- Chart exceptions—where it breaks and who fixes it.
- Highlight manual choke points.

These trees reveal the complexity and prioritize pain points.

## Functional Decomposition

### 1. List Key Capabilities

Slice the DDP into functional chunks:

- Data gathering and cleanup.
- Analysis and decision aids.
- Workflow orchestration.
- Exception tracking.
- Reporting and auditing.

Each chunk gets a clear job, making solutions modular.

### 2. Set Human-Machine Roles

Divvy up the work:

- Automate: Rule-based tasks (e.g., flagging outliers).
- Support: Feed humans data for judgment calls.
- Augment: Boost experts with tools (e.g., scenario simulators).
- Oversee: Humans check complex automation.

This balance respects expertise while scaling efficiency.

### 3. Plan Iterative Releases

Stage your solution:

- Start with a thin, end-to-end slice (e.g., one workflow).
- Expand to new cases or contexts.
- Map dependencies (e.g., data before analysis).
- Build in feedback loops—surveys, metrics—to refine.

## Testing Assumptions and Validation

### 1. Craft Domain Scenarios

Test your grasp with real-world cases:

- Detail typical flows (e.g., a standard order).
- Add edge cases that push limits.
- Vet with experts—tweak as they correct.
- Use these to stress-test solutions.

Scenarios double as benchmarks for success.

### 2. Prototype Knowledge Gaps

Spot flaws early:

- Sketch domain models (e.g., flowcharts).
- Draft decision trees for tricky calls.
- Mock basic interfaces for workflows.
- Run these by experts—fix misunderstandings fast.

These low-stakes tests save rework later.

### 3. Measure What Matters

Tie success to domain wins:

- Pick KPIs experts care about (e.g., error rates, speed).
- Baseline the current mess.
- Set error tolerances (e.g., 5% false positives max).
- Track tech and domain outcomes.

This keeps your focus on value, not just uptime.

## Conclusion

Breaking down a DDP isn’t guesswork—it’s a deliberate mix of mapping expertise, slicing structures, and testing assumptions. Done right, you’ll turn a tangled mess into components that solve the real problem, not just its shadow. Keep domain logic and tech in sync, and you’ll build something that sticks.
