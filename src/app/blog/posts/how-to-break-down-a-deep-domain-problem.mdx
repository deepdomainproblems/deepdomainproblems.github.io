Identifying a Deep Domain Problem (DDP) worth solving is just the start. The real challenge? Breaking it into pieces you can actually tackle. Without a clear breakdown, you’ll either skim the surface or drown in complexity. Here’s a systematic approach to decomposing DDPs into manageable, solvable components.

## Knowledge Extraction and Mapping

### 1. Build a Domain Glossary  
Anchor your work with a shared vocabulary:  
- Capture how experts define key terms (e.g., "risk" in finance vs. manufacturing).  
- Note stakeholder-specific variations—same word, different meanings.  
- Flag subtle distinctions (e.g., "policy" vs. "guideline").  
- Track context-shifting definitions.  

This glossary aligns your team and grounds all analysis.

### 2. Chart Expert Decision-Making  
Unpack how pros navigate the domain:  
- Interview varied experts on key workflows—record steps and gut calls.  
- Pinpoint inputs they weigh (e.g., data, past cases).  
- Highlight forks like "it depends"—these signal critical logic splits.  
- Compare approaches across experts to spot patterns or gaps.  

These maps expose the tacit smarts driving the domain.

### 3. Pinpoint Knowledge Sources  
Locate where truth lives:  
- Formal: Regs, manuals, SOPs.  
- Informal: Expert know-how, unwritten rules.  
- Systems: Databases, legacy tools, external APIs.  
- Tribal: Shop-floor wisdom or team lore.  

Prioritize what to formalize first—start with what’s reliable and accessible.

## Structural Decomposition

### 1. Split Core from Support  
Layer the problem by value:  
- **Core Domain**: What’s unique and high-stakes (e.g., risk scoring in compliance).  
- **Supporting Domains**: Essential but commodity (e.g., data entry).  
- **Generic Elements**: Off-the-shelf stuff (e.g., login systems).  

Focus innovation on the core; leverage existing tools elsewhere.

### 2. Define Bounded Contexts  
Big domains fragment into sub-worlds:  
- Map where concepts shift (e.g., "order" in sales vs. shipping).  
- Trace data handoffs between contexts.  
- Specify translation rules at boundaries.  
- Flag which contexts sync vs. run solo.  

This keeps your solution modular, not a bloated monolith.

### 3. Sketch Process Trees  
For key workflows:  
- Outline the "happy path" from start to finish.  
- Mark decision nodes and their triggers.  
- Chart exceptions—where it breaks, who fixes it.  
- Highlight manual choke points.  

These trees reveal the complexity and prioritize pain points.

## Functional Decomposition

### 1. List Key Capabilities  
Slice the DDP into functional chunks:  
- Data gathering and cleanup.  
- Analysis and decision aids.  
- Workflow orchestration.  
- Exception tracking.  
- Reporting and auditing.  

Each chunk gets a clear job, making solutions modular.

### 2. Set Human-Machine Roles  
Divvy up the work:  
- Automate: Rule-based tasks (e.g., flagging outliers).  
- Support: Feed humans data for judgment calls.  
- Augment: Boost experts with tools (e.g., scenario simulators).  
- Oversee: Humans check complex automation.  

This balance respects expertise while scaling efficiency.

### 3. Plan Iterative Releases  
Stage your solution:  
- Start with a thin, end-to-end slice (e.g., one workflow).  
- Expand to new cases or contexts.  
- Map dependencies (e.g., data before analysis).  
- Build in feedback loops—surveys, metrics—to refine.  

**Quick-Start Checklist**:  
  - ☑ Glossary locked in?  
  - ☑ Decision flows charted?  
  - ☑ Core domain isolated?  
  - ☑ Capabilities assigned?  
  - ☑ First release scoped?  

## Testing Assumptions and Validation

### 1. Craft Domain Scenarios  
Test your grasp with real-world cases:  
- Detail typical flows (e.g., a standard order).  
- Add edge cases that push limits.  
- Vet with experts—tweak as they correct.  
- Use these to stress-test solutions.  

Scenarios double as benchmarks for success.

### 2. Prototype Knowledge Gaps  
Spot flaws early:  
- Sketch domain models (e.g., flowcharts).  
- Draft decision trees for tricky calls.  
- Mock basic interfaces for workflows.  
- Run these by experts—fix misunderstandings fast.  

These low-stakes tests save rework later.

### 3. Measure What Matters  
Tie success to domain wins:  
- Pick KPIs experts care about (e.g., error rates, speed).  
- Baseline the current mess.  
- Set error tolerances (e.g., 5% false positives max).  
- Track tech *and* domain outcomes.  

This keeps your focus on value, not just uptime.

## Case Study: Unpacking AML Compliance  
Take anti-money laundering (AML) in banking:  

### Knowledge Mapping:  
- Cataloged 200+ regs across regions.  
- Traced how officers size up risky transactions.  
- Bridged gaps between policy and practice.  
- Built a glossary—e.g., "suspicious" varies by market.  

### Structural Decomposition:  
- **Core**: Risk scoring and investigation flow.  
- **Supporting**: Customer checks, report filing.  
- **Generic**: Login, logs.  
- Split into contexts: onboarding, monitoring, cases.  

### Functional Capabilities:  
- Risk scoring and alerts.  
- Investigation tools.  
- Evidence logging.  
- Report generation.  
- Audit trails.  

### Human-Machine Roles:  
- Auto: Data pulls, first-pass scoring.  
- Supported: Officers probe alerts with dashboards.  
- Human: Final calls on tricky cases.  

### Iteration Plan:  
1. Monitor one region and one product.  
2. Add investigation and docs.  
3. Automate reporting.  
4. Scale to more regions.  

This turned a sprawling compliance beast into clear, staged wins.

## Conclusion  
Breaking down a DDP isn’t guesswork—it’s a deliberate mix of mapping expertise, slicing structures, and testing assumptions. Done right, you’ll turn a tangled mess into components that solve the real problem, not just its shadow. Keep domain logic and tech in sync, and you’ll build something that sticks.
