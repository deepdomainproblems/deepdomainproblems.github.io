## Introduction

The lending industry presents a classic example of a Deep Domain Problem (DDP), where expert knowledge, regulatory requirements, and complex decision-making intersect. As outlined in [How to Identify Deep Domain Problems Worth Solving](/blog/how-to-identify-deep-domain-problems-worth-solving), let's unpack how professionals navigate this domain by interviewing experts, recording workflows and gut calls, pinpointing inputs, identifying critical forks, and comparing approaches.

## Step 1: Interview Experts and Record Workflows

### Expert 1 (Underwriter): Focuses on risk mitigation

- Steps: Check credit score, review financial statements, assess debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, verify collateral
- Gut call: "If the business seems unstable despite good numbers, I dig deeper into cash flow"

### Expert 2 (Loan Officer): Prioritizes client relationship and feasibility

- Steps: Evaluate business plan, discuss repayment capacity with applicant, check industry trends
- Gut call: "A passionate owner with a solid plan can outweigh a shaky credit history"

### Expert 3 (Analyst): Relies on data models

- Steps: Run credit risk algorithm, compare application to historical defaults, assess market conditions
- Gut call: "Numbers don't lie, but outliers need context—like a sudden market dip"

## Step 2: Pinpoint Inputs

As described in [How to Break Down a Deep Domain Problem](/blog/how-to-break-down-a-deep-domain-problem), we categorize key inputs:

### Data Inputs

- Credit score
- DTI ratio
- Revenue
- Cash flow
- Collateral value

### Qualitative Inputs

- Business plan quality
- Owner credibility
- Industry outlook

### External Inputs

- Market conditions
- Historical loan performance

## Step 3: Highlight Forks ("It Depends")

- Credit score < 600: Immediate rejection vs. consider compensating factors?
- High DTI but strong cash flow: Approve with conditions vs. reject?
- Weak collateral but growing industry: Risk it vs. demand more security?

## Step 4: Compare Approaches

### Pattern

All experts check credit and financials, but weight varies:

- Underwriter: 70% data
- Loan Officer: 50% story
- Analyst: 90% model

### Gap

- Underwriter skips industry trends
- Loan Officer undervalues collateral
- Analyst misses owner intent

## Step 5: Decision-Making Tree

Following the principles from [Ubiquitous Language: The Foundation for Solving Deep Domain Problems](/blog/ubiquitous-language-the-foundation-for-solving-deep-domain-problems), here's a comprehensive decision tree:

```
START: Small Business Loan Application Received
├── Input 1: Credit Score
│   ├── ≥ 600
│   │   ├── Input 2: Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio
│   │   │   ├── ≤ 40%
│   │   │   │   ├── Input 3: Cash Flow (Positive last 12 months?)
│   │   │   │   │   ├── Yes
│   │   │   │   │   │   ├── Input 4: Collateral Value ≥ 50% of Loan?
│   │   │   │   │   │   │   ├── Yes → APPROVE LOAN
│   │   │   │   │   │   │   └── No
│   │   │   │   │   │   │       ├── Input 5: Industry Growth?
│   │   │   │   │   │   │       │   ├── Yes → APPROVE WITH HIGHER RATE
│   │   │   │   │   │   │       │   └── No → REJECT (Weak security)
│   │   │   │   │   └── No
│   │   │   │   │       ├── Input 6: Business Plan Quality
│   │   │   │   │       │   ├── Strong → APPROVE WITH MONITORING
│   │   │   │   │       │   └── Weak → REJECT (Unstable cash flow)
│   │   │   └── > 40%
│   │   │       ├── Input 7: Cash Flow Trend (Improving?)
│   │   │       │   ├── Yes
│   │   │       │   │   ├── Input 8: Owner Credibility
│   │   │       │   │   │   ├── High → APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS
│   │   │       │   │   │   └── Low → REJECT (Risky profile)
│   │   │       │   └── No → REJECT (High DTI, no recovery)
│   │   └── Input 9: Compensating Factors (e.g., Co-signer, Large Deposit)?
│   │       ├── Yes
│   │       │   ├── Return to Input 2 (Reassess DTI with adjustments)
│   │       │   └── If still weak → REJECT
│   │       └── No → REJECT (Credit too low)
│   └── < 600
│       ├── Input 10: Exceptional Circumstances (e.g., Recent bankruptcy recovery)?
│       │   ├── Yes
│       │   │   ├── Input 11: Strong Business Plan + Industry Boom?
│       │   │   │   ├── Yes → APPROVE WITH STRICT TERMS
│       │   │   │   └── No → REJECT
│       │   └── No → REJECT (Credit disqualifies)
└── END
```

## Explanation of the Tree

### Sequential Logic

Starts with a hard filter (credit score), reflecting the underwriter's risk focus, but allows exceptions (loan officer's influence).

### Critical Forks

"It depends" moments like high DTI with improving cash flow or weak collateral in a hot industry capture expert trade-offs.

### Tacit Smarts

Gut calls surface—e.g., "owner credibility" (Loan Officer) tempers data-driven rejection (Analyst), while "industry growth" (Analyst) offsets weak collateral (Underwriter).

### Patterns and Gaps

The tree balances data (credit, DTI) with narrative (business plan, owner), bridging the experts' approaches while exposing gaps (e.g., no one prioritizes market downturns explicitly).

## Conclusion

This decision tree is a practical map of how lending pros navigate approvals, blending hard rules with contextual judgment—exemplifying the principles discussed in [The Evolving Role of Programmers in Solving Deep Domain Problems](/blog/the-evolving-role-of-programmers-in-solving-deep-domain-problems).
